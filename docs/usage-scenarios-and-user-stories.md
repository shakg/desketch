# Usage Scenarios and User Stories

## Usage Scenarios

1. **Start a Local Project**
   - A user opens a project folder to work with local `.tldr` drawings.
   - The sidebar loads the file tree and shows folders and drawings.

2. **Create and Organize Drawings**
   - A user creates a new drawing and a new folder from the sidebar toolbar.
   - They rename items, then drag a drawing into a folder to keep the project tidy.

3. **Find and Open the Right File**
   - A user searches for a drawing by name and opens it with a double click.
   - They sort by date modified to find the most recent file quickly.

4. **Work with Multiple Files**
   - A user selects multiple drawings using Ctrl+Click or Shift+Click.
   - They right-click to access a context menu for bulk actions like delete or move.

5. **Iterate Safely**
   - A user duplicates a drawing before making changes.
   - They save to update the current file or use Save As to create a new one.

6. **Cleanup with Confidence**
   - A user selects multiple items and deletes them.
   - If the current drawing has unsaved changes, they see a warning before deletion.
